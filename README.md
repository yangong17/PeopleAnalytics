## ⭐Orgnostic's Summer People Analytics Challenge – Absenteeism Cost Analysis

### 📌Overview  
This project was developed for Orgnostic's **Summer People Analytics Challenge** and explores the **financial and operational impact of employee absenteeism**. Using a sample HR dataset, the analysis quantified costs, identified behavioral patterns, and recommended actionable strategies to improve workforce efficiency and reduce disruption.

### 📌Approach  
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarized overall absenteeism rates, types of leave (planned vs. unplanned), and cost drivers.  
- **Diagnostic Analysis**: Investigated team-level patterns, identifying spikes in unplanned leave and potential disengagement triggers.  
- **Inferential Statistics**: Calculated the correlation coefficient (r = -0.87) between planned and unplanned leave to support strategic recommendations.  
- **Prescriptive Analytics**: Simulated cost savings under varying policy interventions and replacement efficiency levels.  
- **Financial Modeling**: Developed formulas to calculate basic and overtime-related absenteeism costs using wage data and organizational assumptions.  

### 📌Deliverables  
- PowerPoint presentation summarizing insights with visualizations  
- Excel workbook containing:  
  - Absenteeism cost model  
  - Scenario-based simulations  
  - Dashboard for experimentation  

### 📌Key Outcomes  
- Estimated **total cost of absenteeism** at over $450,000 in a 6-month window  
- Demonstrated potential cost savings of up to $9,623 by shifting unplanned leave to planned leave and improving replacement efficiency  
- Recommended operational strategies such as cross-training and proactive leave planning  

### 📌Skills Demonstrated  
- Statistical Modeling  
- Time Series Analysis  
- Cost Modeling & Simulation  
- Predictive Analytics  
- Data Storytelling and Presentation Design
